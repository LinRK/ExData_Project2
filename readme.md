Hi, thank you for assessing my assignment :)


Please notice below files for this data set.


=CodeBook.md=
a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that  performed to clean up the original data.


 

=run_analysis.R=

This is script to re-produce the df_avg.txt file.
The original data should be stored under the same folder and this folder need to be setup as working directory to make it work.


=df_avg.txt=
This is the data set that shows average of 66 variables that described in the code book.
You can use read.table() to get this into R.
